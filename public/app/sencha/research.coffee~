The communique stated the MOF would not bring any more USD from offshore accounts into the country in 2011, and that the MoF would purchase US1.2 bln in the local market to create a fund abroad to be used for future USD-denominated debt obligations. It also stated the MoF would support the CB, if needed, for curbing further COP appreciation.  We looked at possible scenarios for the MoF cash flow through 2011 to assess if the govt has enough resources to undertake the scheme."}
